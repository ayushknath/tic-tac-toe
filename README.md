# Tic Tac Toe

A two-player tic-tac-toe command line game

## Build from source

1. Clone the source code to your local environment
```
git clone https://github.com/ayushknath/tic-tac-toe.git
```

2. Install `g++` compiler (if you don't have it installed)
- #### Linux
```
sudo apt install g++
```

- #### Windows
You can visit msys2 website to get MinGW toolkit. Just download the `.exe` file and follow the instructions on their website.

- #### MacOS
I don't know man üòì. I've never used Mac, although you can google the steps to install `g++` for MacOS.

3. Build the executable from the source

g++ main.cpp -o play
```

4. Execute the game

- #### Linux
```
./play
```

- #### Windows

./play.exe

- #### MacOS
Please google the process üôè. Although executing the game should be similar to that of Linux
